/// Takes functions `f` and `g` and returns `f âˆ˜ g = |a: A| f(g(a))`.

/// # Examples
/// ```
/// use fntools::compose;
///
/// let add_two = |a: i32| a + 2;
/// let add_three = |a: i32| a + 3;
/// let add_five = compose(add_two, add_three);

/// assert_eq!(add_five(4), 9);
/// ```
///
/// Note the order:
/// ```
/// use fntools::compose;
///
/// let to_16 = |i: i8| i16::from(i);
/// let to_32 = |i: i16| i32::from(i);
/// let to_64 = |i: i32| i64::from(i);

/// // execution order: to_16 -> to_32 -> to_64
/// let i8_to_i64 = compose(compose(to_64, to_32), to_16);
///
/// assert_eq!(i8_to_i64(8i8), 8i64);
